# Food Delivery System

A full-stack web application for managing a food delivery service. The system includes a React.js-based frontend for menu and cart management and a Node.js backend with MongoDB for database operations. Users can browse the menu, add items to the cart, and place orders seamlessly.

---

## Project Features

### Frontend
1. **User Registration and Login**: Secure authentication with JWT tokens.
2. **Menu Management**: View, add, edit, and delete menu items.
3. **Cart Management**: Add items to the cart and manage quantities.
4. **Order Placement**: Place orders from the cart for seamless food delivery.

### Backend
1. **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for handling menu, cart, and user data.
2. **Authentication**: JWT-based secure user authentication.
3. **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for storing user, menu, and order data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Atlas account for database hosting.
- Git installed to clone the repository.

---

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/food-delivery-system.git
   cd food-delivery-system/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-atlas-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add:
   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Deployment

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Use platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
   - Ensure the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the `.env` points to your deployed backend URL.

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy on platforms like Render, Heroku, or Railway.
   - Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from the deployment IPs.

3. **Database**:
   - Use MongoDB Atlas for hosting your database.

4. **Deployed Links**:
   - **Frontend URL**: [Your Frontend URL]
   - **Backend URL**: [Your Backend URL]

## Assumptions, Challenges, and Limitations

### Assumptions
- The user is familiar with React.js, Node.js, and basic API integration.
- The application assumes a single MongoDB Atlas cluster for data management.

### Challenges
- Handling asynchronous operations for database interaction.
- Ensuring secure user authentication using JWT tokens.
- Deploying the backend while managing CORS policies and environment variables.

### Limitations
- The application does not currently support real-time order updates.
- No payment gateway integration for order payments.
- Limited error handling for edge cases.
